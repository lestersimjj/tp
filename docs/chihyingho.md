<h3 id="features">2. Features Implemented </h3>
- Help Command
  - What it does: 
Displays a Help Menu that tells users what each command does and the correct syntax for calling them.
  - Justification: 
Inventory Manager has many commands, each with its own command syntax.<br>
The Help Command will help both new and old users to recall what commands are available and how to call them, <br>
hence allowing them to make full use of the variety of features that Inventory Manager has.
