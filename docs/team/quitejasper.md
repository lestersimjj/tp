<h3 id="features">2. Features Implemented </h3>
- Add Command
    - What it does:
      Adds an item to the inventory list, together with its quantity and description.
    - Justification:
      It is a fundamental feature; items are required in the inventory list for management.
- Delete Command
    - What it does:
      Removes an item from inventory completely.
    - Justification:
      Items may have been added by mistake. This command allows users to rectify by deleting the item before adding the item agan. Items may also be removed for other reasons (e.g. lost, broken etc.).
- ListFutureBorrowings Command
    - What it does:
      Lists all borrowings in the future based on the existing borrow records of every item.
    - Justification:
      Users would be able to quickly retrieve such information for their future planning.
- ListOverdueBorrowings Command
    - What it does:
      Lists all borrowings that are overdue based on the existing borrow records of every item.
    - Justification:
      Users would be able to quickly retrieve such information for their future planning.
